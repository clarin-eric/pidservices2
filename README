To build project (including tests):
-copy config.properties_template to config.properties in src/test/resources
-set GWDG user/password in config.properties


Test 'PidWriterTest': would create new Handle, right now omitted to reduce creation of useless test Handles (can be enabled in PidWriterTest.testPIDWriting() for complete tests)
